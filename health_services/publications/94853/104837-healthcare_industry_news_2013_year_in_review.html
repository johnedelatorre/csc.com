<h2><a id="everywhere"></a>Healthcare Cost Inflation:  A Major Issue Everywhere</h2>
<p><strong>One-third of EU countries have made explicit cuts to their health budgets</strong>, according to a recent article examining how European health systems are changing in response to the financial crisis. England and Hungary are not among the ones cutting their health budgets, but they have frozen their spending. Meanwhile, Belgium, Denmark, and France are choosing to stick to planned increases in public health spending. Most European countries affected by the fiscal crisis have responded over the past three years in at least one of three ways; changing public spending, changing health coverage, and attempting to do more with available resources. (<i><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/03/01/european-health-systems/">European Health Systems Are Changing in Response to the Financial Crisis but Face Barriers to Implementing Necessary Reforms</a></i>, <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/03/01/european-health-systems/"><i>LSE Blog</i></a>, March 2013)</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2013/Variation-in-Health-Care-Spending-Target-Decision-Making-Not-Geography.aspx">Institute of Medicine</a> investigation into regional healthcare cost variations promises to reinvigorate an already lively debate and discussion about the issue of how to craft policy and payment practices that accurately reflect the drivers of cost variation. The report looks at regional healthcare cost variation for Medicare and for private sector payers and concludes that the reasons for cost variation in the two segments are different – a finding that undermines the traditional explanation that it is the underlying variations in regional cost structures that are driving differences. Specifically, the study finds that Medicare regional cost variation is largely a function of cost variation for post-acute care services.  When those costs are "normalized" across regions, it accounts for 73 percent of total cost variation.  By contrast, private sector payer regional cost variation is found to be almost entirely accounted for by variations in the reimbursement rates that hospitals and physicians have negotiated with payers.  When variations in negotiated rates are "normalized" across regions in the study, it accounts for 70 percent of the regional cost variation in the private sector.  These conclusions are somewhat different conclusions and recommendations than the Dartmouth Studies have produced – and there has been considerable noise about that in the OpEd pages and blogosphere.  The commentary and apparent dispute notwithstanding, what is clear is that you cannot take regional cost variation at face value (because we do not really know what the underlying cost structures are), and it may also illustrate another example of that old joke "if you take 10 economists and line them up end-to-end....they point in every direction at once."  (<a href="http://www.csc.com/health_services/publications/94853/Variation%20in%20Health%20Care%20Spending:%20Target%20Decision%20Making,%20Not%20Geography,%20Institute%20of%20Medicine">Variation in Health Care Spending: Target Decision Making, Not Geography, Institute of Medicine</a>, July 2013)</p>
<h2><a id="Consumers"></a>Consumers Take Charge:  Researching and Learning About Their Conditions</h2>
<p><strong>Consumers are beginning to search for online rating systems to guide their decision making in healthcare just like in other areas of life</strong>, according to a new report from PwC. Increasingly, consumers report that they want to see grades and scores on their doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies. A survey of 1,000 consumers has revealed that no favorite has yet emerged, although word of mouth remains the strongest influencer.  Consumers' top concerns are the physician-patient relationship, understanding what to do after a clinic or hospital visit, and how to obtain more helpful service from their health plans. (<i><a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/scoringhealthcare">Scoring Healthcare: Navigating Customer Experience Ratings</a></i>, <i><a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/scoringhealthcare">PwC</a></i>, April 2013)</p>
<p>Approximately <strong>75 percent of all U.S. adult consumers who use the Internet say that they own at least one fitness technology product</strong>, according to a new survey. The authors of the accompanying report say that the market for dedicated wearable fitness devices will continue to grow, but were quick to point out that growth could come in many areas and that no one particular device is dominant right now. (<a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/wearable-fitness-devices-see-historic-surge-popularity">Wearable Fitness Devices See Historic Surge in Popularity</a>, <i><a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/wearable-fitness-devices-see-historic-surge-popularity"><em>mHealthNews</em></a></i>, December 12, 2013)</p>
<h2><a id="Patients"></a>Patients and Healthcare Providers Everywhere Are Going Mobile</h2>
<p><strong>The European Union could potentially save nearly 100 billion euros and add 93 billion euros in gross domestic product over the next four years by embracing mobile health solutions</strong>, according to a report from <a href="http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/gsma-the-adoption">GSMA</a> (an association of global mobile system operators). The authors argue that mHealth can make chronic care more effective and improve the efficiency with which healthcare resources are used. Better treatment compliance and remote patient monitoring could reduce care costs for chronic conditions by 30 to 35 percent, according to the estimates. The researchers conclude that harnessing the power of mHealth could help 185 million patients gain a total of 158,000 additional years of life, engage 23 million chronic disease sufferers as active participants in their care, and provide early diagnosis and and intervention to more than 9.4 million patients at risk for chronic disease.

<h2><a id="bigdata"></a>Big Data and Personalized Medicine Are Exciting, but They Are Still Not at the Bedside</h2>
<p>There are significant <strong>health policy and financing challenges to making genomic medicine practicable at the point of care</strong> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing evidence, and standardized criteria, to support and align stakeholder evaluation of value;</li>
<li>Proving the analytic and clinical validity of genetic testing;</li>
<li>Demonstrating that innovations provide greater value in actual practice;</li>
<li>Addressing current deficiencies of the medical coding system (most tests have no identifiable codes);</li>
<li>Providing clinical guidance (available at the point of care) and translation of that guidance into the measures upon which reimbursement will be based; and</li>
<li>Engaging patients in shared decision-making (including attention to genetic literacy and informed consent).</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors of the article argue that these issues must be addressed before significant progress can be made.  (<a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/Mobile/article.aspx?articleid=1677384">Accessing Genomic Medicine: Affordability, Diffusion, and Disparities</a>, <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/Mobile/article.aspx?articleid=1677384"><i>JAMA</i></a>, April 10, 2013 – subscription or purchase required)</p>
<p><strong>Google is investing in a new health tech company called "Calico,"</strong> short for "California Life Company." The venture will use Big Data analytics to address the challenge of aging and related diseases, according to Google. Google co-founder Larry Page commented, "With some longer term, moon-shot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives." What Calico is and how it will work has not been identified in much detail yet. The goal appears to be to find ways to slow disease by leveraging the many "huge unstructured databases" to be found across the medical and life sciences industries. We will have to wait to see.

<h2><a id="valuebased"></a>The Move to Value-Based Payment is Underway, but U.S. Providers and Payers Are Still Figuring Out How to Adapt</h2>
<p>Providing yet another sign that the movement to a value-based care system is underway, one of the findings of the Medical Group Management Association's 2012 survey of 1,422 medical directors in 239 U.S. medical organizations is that <strong>40 percent of responding medical directors reported their duties and compensation were tied to quality metrics</strong>, such as length of patient stay, patient safety, patient satisfaction, CMS core measures, compliance, readmissions, and staff and provider satisfaction.  (<a href="http://www.mgma.com/press/default.aspx?id=1374348">MGMA Survey Report: Almost 40 Percent of Respondents Indicate Medical Directorship Duties Are Tied to Quality Metrics</a>, <i><a href="http://www.mgma.com/press/default.aspx?id=1374348">MGMA</a></i>, April 24, 2013)</p>
<p><strong>During the current transition to value-based reimbursement for healthcare, hospitals face sometimes conflicting incentives to improve performance</strong> in line with targeted quality and safety metrics. A team from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health has illustrated this in an analysis of administrative data for all inpatient surgical discharges during 2010 from a non-profit, 12-hospital system in the southern U.S. The goal was to evaluate the fixed and variable hospital costs and revenues associated with the occurrence of one or more major post-surgical complications for nine common procedure groups for four payer types – private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and self-payment. They found that the financial effects of surgical complications varied considerably by payer type. In the hospital system studied, under private insurance and Medicare, surgical complications were associated with higher hospital contribution margins (revenue minus variable costs) than was the case for patients covered by Medicaid and who self-paid.  The bottom line result?  Improvements in quality and patient safety through reductions in surgical complications may erode financial performance, under current reimbursement rules.  (<a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1679400">Relationship between Occurrence of Surgical Complications and Hospital Finances</a>, <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1679400"><i>JAMA</i></a>, April 17, 2013 – subscription or purchase required)</p>
<p><strong>Provider networks in UnitedHealth group plans can expect rapid growth in value-based reimbursements over the next five years. </strong> Currently, UnitedHealth expenditures for accountable care type provider contracts currently run about $20 billion per year representing roughly 25 percent of total medical claims expenditures.  Company officials predict that accountable care and value-based reimbursements will grow to $50 billion by 2017 – doubling the current proportion of spending.  UnitedHealth's strategy is in line with other commercial and non-profit health plans.  Aetna, Cigna, Humana and most Blue Cross Blue Shield plans are making significant investments in payment mechanisms designed to move away from traditional fee-for-service mechanisms.  It is worth noting, however, that this growth in value-based and accountable care reimbursement is expanding on the private sector side at the same time that several high profile provider organizations have announced their intention to withdraw from the Medicare ACO Pioneer program.  (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/07/10/unitedhealthcare-makes-50-billion-wager-on-accountable-care-as-obamacare-looms/">UnitedHealthcare Makes $50 Billion Wager on Accountable Care as Obamacare Looms</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/07/10/unitedhealthcare-makes-50-billion-wager-on-accountable-care-as-obamacare-looms/"><i>Forbes</i></a>, July 10, 2013)</p>
<h2><a id="organizations"></a>Organizations Continue to Struggle to Bring Quality Measurement into the Twenty-First Century</h2>
<p>At least one large provider organization is making progress in replacing the totally manual assembly of patient information for quality measurement with electronic health record (EHR)-enabled measurement. According to a recently study in the <a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/08/04/amiajnl-2013-001789.short?g=w_jamia_ahead_tab">Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</a>, Kaiser Permanente chose 21 measures from six of the domains of hospital core measures – those for acute myocardial infarction, ED patient flow, immunizations, the surgical care improvement project (SCIP), pneumonia and VTE prophylaxis – as the first for EHR-based measurement. The approach taken is really EHR-enabled extraction rather than direct measurement reporting.  A comparison of pre- and post-automation extraction time for each of 20 randomly sampled records required for each measure revealed time savings of 14 minutes per case (VTE) to 5 minutes per case (PN, IMM, ED).  For the SCIP measures alone, extraction time dropped by 50 percent. However, substantial effort was required upfront to interpret, map, code, and verify validity of the data elements. Furthermore, Kaiser Permanente has worked to ensure a significant degree of standardization across sites as the EHR has been rolled out.  The authors cite a <a href="http://assets1.csc.com/health_services/downloads/CSC_Hospital_Quality_Reporting_The_Hidden_Requirements_of_Meaningful_Use.pdf">paper</a> from the <a href="../../insights.html">CSC's Global Institute for Emerging Healthcare Practices</a> showing that as few as 35 percent of the data elements needed for hospital quality reporting for Stage 1 meaningful use are readily available from the EHR. The Kaiser team was able to target from 8 to 93 data elements for each measure and increased the capture rate overall to 61 percent. They also cite a prior Global Institute <a href="http://assets1.csc.com/health_services/downloads/CSC_Core_Measures.pdf">study</a> of core measures(<a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/08/04/amiajnl-2013-001789.short?g=w_jamia_ahead_tab">e-Measures: Insight into the Challenges and Opportunities of Automating Publicly Reported Quality Measures</a>, <a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/08/04/amiajnl-2013-001789.short?g=w_jamia_ahead_tab"><i>Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</i></a>, July 5, 2013)</p>
<p>A recent paper from Australia started to answer two inter-related questions about CPOE (called electronic prescribing in the article): <strong>what is the nature and extent of new error types associated with the introduction of electronic prescribing systems (ePS) and does it prevent more prescribing errors than it generates?</strong> Two different commercial, inpatient CPOE systems were studied (Cerner Millenium PowerOrders and CSC MedChart) as implemented at two teaching hospitals in Sydney via an audit of 629 admissions in total. The audit showed that system-related errors are frequent, yet few are detected. Of the overall count of 1,164 prescribing errors, 42.4 percent were system-related (for MedChart, 42.6 percent, and for Cerner 41.9 percent). (Standard practice, as described by the authors, did not require pharmacist review of med orders before administration; despite this, there was evidence that 13.4 percent of system errors were detected prior to the study audit.)  The two CPOE systems differed in their designs and reliance upon selection and editing of information presented by the system.

<h2><a id="privacy"></a>Privacy and Security Rules Get Serious</h2>
<p><strong>Early 2013 witnessed the publication of the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/01/25/2013-01073/modifications-to-the-hipaa-privacy-security-enforcement-and-breach-notification-rules-under-the">final "omnibus" rule on privacy and security</a> by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</strong> The new rule implements a number of provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, including assigning new responsibilities to healthcare providers, health plans, and other covered entities. For the first time, HIPAA liability is extended to business associates. The rule also indicates a new focus toward active enforcement on the part of the government, raising the stakes for covered entities. Under the new final rule, business associates of covered entities are directly liable for compliance with HIPAA requirements and must enter into written contracts called business associate agreements.  There are  new tighter  the limitations on the use and disclosure of PHI for marketing purposes by requiring covered entities to obtain authorization from individuals if the covered entity receives payment for producing or distributing the materials. Covered entities now bear the burden of proof for all breaches, making the business associate certification even more important for covered entities.  The maximum penalty for noncompliance due to negligence has been increased, with a new maximum of $1.5 million per violation. For a more detailed look at the other modifications to HIPAA included in the final rule, see CSC's white paper, <a href="../../insights/95381-update_on_the_hipaa_privacy_and_security_final_rule.html">Update on the HIPAA Privacy and Security Final Rule</a>, <i><a href="../../insights/95381-update_on_the_hipaa_privacy_and_security_final_rule.html">CSC</a></i>, February 2013)</p>
<p><strong>A New York-based health plan will pay HHS a fine of $1.2 million for violating new HIPAA privacy and security rules.</strong> The misstep was revealed as part of an investigatory report by CBS Evening News. The news network purchased a photocopier that had been previously leased by the health plan and found that the photocopier's hard drive contained confidential medical information that had not been properly erased. As many as 344,579 individuals may have been affected by the breach. The Office for Civil Rights conducted an investigation and found that the plan had "impermissibly disclosed the protected health information of these affected individuals when it returned multiple photocopiers to leasing agents without erasing the data contained on the copier hard drives."  (<a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/12m-photocopy-breach-proves-costly">At $1.2M, Photocopy Breach Proves Costly</a>, <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/12m-photocopy-breach-proves-costly"><i>Healthcare IT News</i></a>, August 14, 2013)</p>
<h2><a id="pharmacy"></a>More Pharmacy Blockbusters in the Works</h2>
<p><strong>There are apparently more than 5,000 new medicines in the pipeline globally</strong>, and many of those are targeted at untreated diseases and life-threatening conditions, according to a new report from the industry group PhRMA. Most of these therapies, however, are in the early stages of development. Fewer than 1000 of the 5400 drugs in clinical development have reached stage III, and only 82 are headed for market following approval by the FDA.  As <a href="http://blog.pharmexec.com/2013/01/21/will-robust-pipeline-yield-more-new-drugs/"><i>PharmExec</i></a> notes, the attrition from Phase II to Phase III is traditionally very high so it is far from known how many of those therapies will ever actually hit the shelves. Recent regulatory changes pertaining to the diversity of therapies allowed by the FDA to move forward, however, could help more potential medicines make it to later stages.

<p><strong>Pharmaceutical manufacturers will have fewer drug approvals in 2013 than in 2012, but arguably the industry has traded quantity for quality</strong>, according to a <a href="http://www.evaluategroup.com/EPVantage-FDA-Approvals">new report</a> from market research group <a href="http://www.evaluategroup.com/EPVantage-FDA-Approvals">Evaluate</a>. The year will likely end with about 34 drugs and biologics approved, down from a record 43 in 2012, but this year's new blockbusters are expected to have a greater five-year revenue potential than ever before. ($18.7 billion in projected sales versus the previous record of $16.4 billion.)  In 2013, the industry "[moved] away from me-too drugs and [put] its efforts behind drugs for hard-to-treat and specialist diseases." According to the report, "Increased efforts on the part of the FDA to speed up drug development and also companies choosing to expand into rare diseases or niche patient populations is having a big impact on productivity."

<h2><a id="healthreform"></a>Health Reform Efforts Accelerate Healthcare Industry Transformation</h2>
<p>The story on the federal Health Insurance Exchange, its troubled implementation, and the plans to fix it, is changing almost hourly as new resources are brought in for what is being billed as a "technical surge" – deadlines under the ACA are being adjusted and reexamined as Congress embarks on the inevitable round of endless hearings to determine who is to blame.  The performance of the exchanges to date has been at best disappointing and, at worst, a disaster.  But, <strong>is it a surprise that the Exchange does not work as hoped?  It probably should not be</strong>, according to historical analysis in <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243396/Healthcare.gov_website_didn_t_have_a_chance_in_hell_">Computerworld</a>.  After all, the success rate for large, multi-million dollar IT projects (commercial or public sector) is very low.  Looking at 10 years of commercial and private sector IT project data – for projects with labor costs of at least $10 million – less than 7 percent are "successful".  More than half (52%) of those large projects were "challenged", meaning they went over budget, were late, or failed to meet expectations, and 41.4 percent were complete failures that were either abandoned or cancelled and started over.

<p><strong>Evidence is mounting that the use of private health insurance exchanges is accelerating as the public exchanges promote the creation of "exchange-ready" products from health plans, and employers look to defined-contribution plans as a mechanism to lower their employee healthcare coverage costs.  </strong>A <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Are-You-Ready-Private-Health-Insurance-Exchanges-Are-Looming.pdf">recent study</a> by Accenture predicts that by 2017 approximately 18 percent of the American public will purchase insurance through exchanges.  <a href="http://arrayhealth.com/the-new-marketplaces-health-insurers-expected-to-broaden-distribution-channels/">Another recent survey</a> found that 93 percent of health benefit industry insiders believe that the majority of employer sponsors of healthcare coverage will move to a defined-contribution model (which will require the use of a private exchange).  Another finding, from the same study, was that 70 percent of health insurers expect to participate in both private and public exchanges within the next year – and the percentage that expect to participate in a private exchange is even higher.  (<a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Are-You-Ready-Private-Health-Insurance-Exchanges-Are-Looming.pdf">Are You Ready?

<p>In the U.S., the incentive program for adopting electronic health records (EHRs) and using them in a meaningful way has greatly increased the usage of those systems. According to the most recent numbers from the U.S. government, <strong>CMS has disbursed nearly $17 billion in Meaningful Use incentive payments to eligible hospitals and medical professionals demonstrating meaningful use of certified electronic health record systems</strong>. As of the end of October, more than 430,000 eligible hospitals and professionals had achieved meaningful use of EHRs, and 93 percent of eligible hospitals had registered for the meaningful use program. More than 236,000 Medicare-eligible doctors and 139,000 Medicaid-eligible doctors had also attested to the program.  Despite the many rollouts, there remain opportunities and challenges in terms of optimizing the use of the technology. To that end, CMS and other industry groups are issuing tip sheets and guides. A recently published tip sheet from CMS is aimed at helping eligible professionals gather the right data elements and improve their capability for sharing information with other parties. The process is complex. As the guide notes, "While some of the data elements are common between these three objectives, other data elements are individual to each objective."  There are many success stories, yet some <strong>physicians who have implemented electronic health record (EHR) systems are not very satisfied with their experiences</strong>, according to a report from IDC Health Insights. A study of buyer satisfaction among ambulatory physician practices (of those who bought in 2012) found that 58 percent of respondents were neutral, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied with their EHR. The top reasons given were lost productivity resulting from poor usability, inappropriate form factors and user interfaces,  unsatisfactory access to mobile technology, poor workflow tools and configurations, inadequate training and support, and poor application availability. A majority of respondents who said they achieved meaningful use reported being stuck at lower productivity levels than before EHR adoption.  (<a href="http://www.govhealthit.com/news/17b-paid-out-mu-so-far-onc-looks-stage-3">Meaningful Use Incentive Payments Soar Toward $17B</a>, <i><a href="http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2013/12/4/medicare-physician-fee-schedule-expands-telehealth-coverage"><em>Government Health IT</em></a></i>, December 4, 2013; <i><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/Stage2_DataSharing_FactSheetFinal_10182013.pdf">Stage 2 Data Elements Tipsheet for Eligible Professionals</a></i>, <i><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/Stage2_DataSharing_FactSheetFinal_10182013.pdf">CMS</a></i>, October 2013; <i><a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/survey-physician-dissatisfaction-with-ehr-high-46898-1.html?ET=healthdatamanagement:e4040:117919a:&st=email&utm_source=editorial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=HDM_DAILY_111513_111413">IDC Health Survey: Physician Dissatisfaction with EHRs High</a></i>, <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/survey-physician-dissatisfaction-with-ehr-high-46898-1.html?ET=healthdatamanagement:e4040:117919a:&st=email&utm_source=editorial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=HDM_DAILY_111513_111413"><i>Health Data Management</i></a>, November 14, 2013)</p>
<p><strong>Only 46 percent of U.S. physician groups plan to participate in a health information exchange (HIE)</strong> according to new information from HIMSS Analytics.  Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) are a critical enabler for effectively sharing and using information across the continuum of care – and at less than 50 percent physician participation, it is unlikely that the accountable care and coordinated care objectives of many health reform efforts will be realized.  Some key findings about ambulatory EHR adoption include 73 percent of respondents reported having purchased an ambulatory EHR solution; 65 percent of respondents reported that they are not planning to purchase, replace, or upgrade their ambulatory EHR system; 17 percent reported that they will upgrade a current solution, 12 percent reported purchasing a new solution, and 6 percent reported replacing a current solution; Nearly 80 percent of physicians planning to purchase, upgrade, or replace their EHR reported that they will do so in the next 7 to 12 months; 36 percent identified practice efficiency improvements as the main driver for EHR replacement; 21 percent said improving quality of care was the main driver; and 17 percent reported that it was required to make it easier to share patient data among facilities. Sixty percent of physician groups reported that they had successfully attested to Stage 1 of meaningful use, and 48 percent have received their incentive payments.  (<a href="http://beckersspine.com/hitmeaningful-useemr/item/16232-27-statistics-on-ambulatory-ehrs-practice-management-solutions">27 Statistics on Ambulatory EHRs, Practice Management Solutions</a>, <a href="http://beckersspine.com/hitmeaningful-useemr/item/16232-27-statistics-on-ambulatory-ehrs-practice-management-solutions"><i>Becker’s Spine Review</i></a>, June 2013)</p>

<p><strong>Will the next generation of health IT Web sites and startups be centered around interactive coaching experiences?</strong> If Web 1.0 was characterized by static information and Web 2.0 characterized by user-generated content, perhaps Web 3.0 will be about synchronous and asynchronous coaching. Several examples were presented and discussed at the Center for Connected Health's recent <a href="http://symposium.connected-health.org/">Connected Health Symposium</a>, including new companies Omada and VTrim, as well as established companies such as Weight Watchers.  <a href="http://omadahealth.com/">Omada</a> offers pre-diabetes assistance to individuals who are at risk for developing diabetes. Rather than offering just a Web site with static tips and advice, individuals enroll in a <strong>16-week online program</strong> designed to get people to become highly engaged by walking them through daily actions and behavior changes that can help them lose weight and improve their diet. Enrollees get a digital scale in the mail and then use that in conjunction with the Web site (which features coaching, lessons, and group discussions). They have been able to get people to lose 6 percent of their body weight in mere weeks.  Similarly, <a href="http://www.vtrimonline.com/">VTrim</a> helps people "lose weight and keep it off" through their "Internet-assisted obesity treatment" program. They offer <strong>12- and 24-week courses</strong> that include hour-long classes each week with registered dietitians. All of the interactions happen online via the Web site and via texting. Interestingly, there are purposely no instructional videos on the site since the philosophy of the company is that real, live expert-led communities are more effective at building engagement.

<p><strong>Physicians and consumers have strikingly different preferences when it comes to providing patient access to their electronic health records (EHRs)</strong> according to a recent survey of consumers and physicians in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, Germany, Singapore, Spain, and the United States.  Overall, 84 percent of consumers supported full access for patients while only 36 percent of physicians supported complete access.  Among U.S. consumers, access to their EHR is so important that 41 percent responded that they would be willing to change providers in order to get better access to their records.  ((<i><a href="http://newsroom.accenture.com/news/more-than-40-percent-of-us-consumers-willing-to-switch-physicians-to-gain-online-access-to-electronic-medical-records-according-to-accenture-survey.htm">More than Forty Percent of U.S. Consumers Willing to Switch Physicians to Gain Online Access to Electronic Medical Records, According to Accenture Survey</a></i>, <a href="http://newsroom.accenture.com/news/more-than-40-percent-of-us-consumers-willing-to-switch-physicians-to-gain-online-access-to-electronic-medical-records-according-to-accenture-survey.htm"><i><em>Accenture</em></i></a>, September 16, 2013)</p>
<p><strong>More than three-quarters (77%) of patients want to be able to have email consultations with their doctor, but few organizations and physicians are offering this communication channel</strong>. According to numbers from a recent poll, only 6 percent of patients said that they are able to email with their doctor. The two major problems identified by researchers are addressing the compensation and reimbursement issues associated with virtual patient interactions, and ensuring that privacy and security standards are effective and appropriate.  Responding to an email is both more time-intensive and less personal (and thus less secure) than taking a phone call from a patient, according to physicians, but consumers' expectations don't reflect this assessment.  In fact, nearly half of those surveyed thought e-mail consultations should be free. One approach being tested out at many physician practices is to charge a general "service fee" for e-mail services (for those who want that capability). (<a href="http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/PHY-297926/3-in-4-Patients-Want-Email-Consultations-with-Doctors">3 in 4 Patients Want E-mail Consultations with Doctor</a>, <a href="http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/PHY-297926/3-in-4-Patients-Want-Email-Consultations-with-Doctors"><i>HealthLeaders Media</i></a>, November 1, 2013)</p>
<h3><a id="Security"></a>When It Comes to IT Security, Bring-Your-Own-Device Policies Make Things Tricky</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The BYOD (bring your own device) movement has its advantages and disadvantages in the modern hospital IT environment.</strong> According to one expert in <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/3-ways-make-byod-fairly-easy?single-page=true">Healthcare IT News</a>, there are three keys to striking the right balance between organizational security and individual convenience for BYOD. Make the system invisible to minimize impact on BYOD users and their workflow; consider offering a downloadable enterprise app that puts everyone on the same security page.  Build a secure sandbox by implementing a desktop virtualization program across all enterprise computers. With a virtualization system, users will have access to the same programs no matter where they are.  Finally, make it simple.  Eliminate the smorgasbord of passwords and log-ins. Assign each staff member an ID badge with an embedded RFID chip so that once they log in at the beginning of the shift they are able to use just about any computer in the building.  (<a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/3-ways-make-byod-fairly-easy?single-page=true">3 Ways to Make BYOD (Fairly) Easy</a>, <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/3-ways-make-byod-fairly-easy?single-page=true"><i>Healthcare IT News</i></a>, November 5, 2013)</p>
<h3><a id="line"></a>The Line Between Mobile Health App and Medical Device Is Blurring</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>uCheck is a clever new mobile health app that can perform a urinalysis check.</strong> The app uses the iPhone camera to first calibrate using standard medical supply chemical strips and then comparing the colors that emerge on the urine-soaked strip to a color-coded key. The result is the ability to measure amounts of glucose, bilirubin, proteins, specific gravity, ketones, leukocytes, nitrites, urobilinogen, and hematuria present in the urine. The app was doing well (and was even featured at a TED conference) until recently.  The Food and Drug Administration sent a letter admonishing the developer that it needs FDA clearance for the app and causing confusion in the industry. The FDA has been unclear about which types of apps could be regulated. Final guidance is due in the fall of 2013. Developers hope it will settle outstanding questions and confusion.

<p>A new smartphone accessory called <strong>Nutriphone lets users test cholesterol levels, saliva pH, and vitamin deficiency.</strong> Developed by two students at Cornell University, the device is one of the few chemical sensors available for smartphones. The prototype attaches to a phone over the phone's rear-facing camera. The camera is used to read colorimetric test strips specific to particular biomarkers. The user inserts a test strip into a chamber and the phone's camera captures an image for analysis. Track and field athletes on the Cornell campus were among the first to test and use the app. "[T]hey could test their pH level throughout their runs over a 30 to 60 minute period [and] correlate that to sodium loss and ultimately to sweat loss."

<p><strong>A smartphone app designed for weight-loss intervention has emerged from a pilot trial being found "feasible and acceptable"</strong> as compared to other modes (e.g., Web site and paper diary). The app was designed by researchers at the University of Leeds in the UK and allows users to set a weight-loss goal and self-monitor their daily caloric intake toward achieving that goal. Other features – like a food and physical activity diary – are available and allow users access to real time information that can be used to modify their activity levels.  Finally, there is a system of personalized support messages to encourage and incent progress and improved performance.  The article found physical activity app users self-monitored exercise more frequently over the six-month study and reported greater intentional physical activity than non-app users.  (<a href="http://www.fiercemobilehealthcare.com/story/smartphone-weight-loss-app-effective-self-monitoring-diet-activity/2013-04-15?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal">Smartphone Weight Loss App Effective for Self-monitoring of DIET, Activity</a>, <a href="http://www.fiercemobilehealthcare.com/story/smartphone-weight-loss-app-effective-self-monitoring-diet-activity/2013-04-15?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal"><i>FierceMobileHealthcare</i></a>, April 15 2013)</p>
<h3><a id="medicaldevices"></a>Medical Devices Emerge as a New Security Worry for Provider Organizations</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hospital IT executives are saying that <strong>medical device manufacturers are resisting requests to improve the security of their products</strong>, reports the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/08/05/medical-device-makers-slow-to-address-cyber-risks-hospitals-complain/">Wall Street Journal</a>. According to hospitals, the manufacturers are primarily concerned about opening themselves up to FDA medical device regulations, fearing that modifying their devices to add new security measures might require them to re-submit their devices for approval. Service contracts that rely on fixed schedules for updates are also creating the impression that the device makers are being slow to react. Meanwhile, the FDA is trying to assuage the fears of manufacturers, saying that it "typically does not need to review or approve medical device software changes made solely to strengthen cybersecurity." In recent months, the FDA has recommended that medical device companies develop security controls to limit malfunctions resulting from computer viruses and protect the confidentiality and integrity of data.  (<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/08/05/medical-device-makers-slow-to-address-cyber-risks-hospitals-complain/">Medical Device Makers Slow to Address Cyber Risks, Hospitals Complain</a>, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/08/05/medical-device-makers-slow-to-address-cyber-risks-hospitals-complain/"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a>, August 5, 2013)</p>
<p><strong>The FDA has issued a warning to healthcare organizations about malware and viruses on medical devices.</strong> The advisory is intended for medical device manufacturers, hospitals, medical device user facilities, health care IT and procurement staff, and biomedical engineers. It recommends that medical device manufacturers and healthcare facilities "take steps to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of failure due to cyberattack, which could be initiated by the introduction of malware into the medical equipment or unauthorized access to configuration settings in medical devices and hospital networks."  No patient injuries have been reported yet in the U.S. as a result of such attacks, but the FDA believes there is a need for heightened awareness in areas including network-connected configured medical devices that could be infected or disabled by malware, the presence of malware on hospital computers, smartphones and tablets, targeting mobile devices using wireless technology to access patient data, monitoring systems, and implanted patient devices and failure to provide timely security software updates and patches to medical devices and networks and to address related vulnerabilities in older medical device models (legacy devices).

<h3><a id="wearables"></a>An Explosion of Mobile Health Technology "Wearables"</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Consumer interest in, and use of, wearable health and medical devices is high and growing, and 5 percent of adults now say they are using some sort of a wearable device to monitor physical activity or wellness indicators. </strong> Consumers have strong preferences about wearable devices as well and are about evenly split between those who prefer a device that clips on to clothing (29%) and those who liked ones that attached to the wrist (29%).  Unfortunately, the accuracy of many of the devices, particularly accelerometers, which are designed to measure physical activity, is often problematic.  Accelerometers, which are typically designed to be worn at the hip or at the wrist, sense movement and then use logical algorithms to interpret the movement in terms of expended energy – usually in the form of calories. <strong> Little independent verification of the accuracy of the readings is available to consumers</strong>, though, and recent studies suggest that devices are reasonably accurate when assessing high levels of activity (like running), but as the pace of the activity that is measured gets lower (like housecleaning) the accuracy degrades significantly.  Apparently the accuracy problem is even worse for activities like bicycling that have no significant levels of arm movement.  (<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/18/us-summit-wearables-idUKBRE95H01P20130618">Batteries Hold Key to Wearable Device Revolution</a>, <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/18/us-summit-wearables-idUKBRE95H01P20130618"><i><em>Reuters</em></i></a>, June 18, 2013; <i><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/how-accurate-are-fitness-monitors/?_r=1">How Accurate Are Fitness Trackers?</a></i> <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/how-accurate-are-fitness-monitors/?_r=1"><i><em>NYTimes</em></i></a>, June 12, 2013)</p>
<p><strong>Are you ready for mobile health technology to start moving into apparel, jewelry, accessories, and other types of wearable items?</strong> Sports clothing company Under Armour has acquired the Texas-based health app company MapMyFitness for a reported $150 million. The health app company has about 20 million registered users and offers "running, biking, and walking apps and social networks that integrate with a wide array of other digital health apps." A key feature of the apps is that they are GPS-enabled so that users can map, record, and share their workouts with friends and family. MapMyFitness has a little over 100 employees. Under Armour has dabbled in this space before. It was involved with bringing a sensor-outfitted shirt to the NFL Combine in 2011 but had not expanded this part of its business very far.  (<a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/27387/under-armour-acquires-mapmyfitness-for-150m/">Under Armour Acquires MapMyFitness for $150M</a>, <a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/27387/under-armour-acquires-mapmyfitness-for-150m/"><i>mobihealthnews</i></a>, November 14, 2013)</p>

The watch, called the Galaxy Gear, has a 3-inch screen and a camera built into the watch strap. In a related story, in August, Samsung launched a new gamified health app in Korea called Health Buddy but has not announced any plans to launch the app in the US.  (<a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/25171/samsung-taps-azumio-for-smartwatch-fitness-app/">Samsung Taps Azumio for Smartwatch Fitness App</a>, <a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/25171/samsung-taps-azumio-for-smartwatch-fitness-app/"><i>mobihealthnews</i></a>, September 5, 2013)</p>
<h3><a id="Printing"></a>3D Printing:  Lots of Hype but Will Hospitals Put It into Practice?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>One of the hottest new technologies of the past few years has been 3-D printing – the technique of laying down fine layers of substance (usually plastics or resins) in precise alignments to make tools, models, and even prosthetic body parts. Unfortunately, though, some of the chemicals and materials used in 3-D printing can be toxic. To overcome that, <strong>researchers are experimenting replacing the toxic materials with naturally-occurring riboflavin or vitamin B2</strong>.  Because it is not rejected by the human body, riboflavin could be particularly good for use in "3-D printed medical implants, micro-needles, or scaffolding to build custom body parts in the lab." Researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, say the new material "appears to hold up pretty well," but they are working on improving its durability.

For the study, researchers looked at implanted including defibrillating cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-Ds) devices (58% of patients) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) (42% of patients). A total of 716 patients were randomized to home monitoring or a control group with standard care.  After 12 months, patients who received the home-monitoring were healthier, and fewer home-monitoring patients died of any cause over the study period.  The results stand in contrast to the results of other studies of remote monitoring systems for heart failure patients, which had hitherto shown mixed results. One possible explanation is that the remote monitoring system required so little participation on the part of the patient.

<p><strong>The use of telemedicine by Kingaroy Hospital in Australia is saving elderly patients the need to make long and arduous trips for medical visits.</strong> The small pilot program has been a great success, according to the hospital. The system allows patients to go to a local outpost yet still see senior doctors from more urban areas with greater numbers of specialists. The pilot has enabled 46 patients to be diagnosed and treated remotely. It has been extended for another 12 months of funding, at which time it will be evaluated again.

<p><strong>The new 2014 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule released by CMS expands coverage for telehealth services and increases the reimbursement payments for such services</strong>. The new fee schedule expands coverage to rural areas as defined by the Office of Rural Health Policy, and (slightly) increases telehealth reimbursement rates for originating patient sites from $24.43 to $24.63. A website will be made available to help healthcare providers determine whether they are eligible as a rural originating site.

<p><strong>Are drop-down menus killing patients?</strong> That is a sensationalized headline, but a recent Australian study on electronic prescribing systems did find that computer systems with fewer drop-down menus were associated with fewer prescription errors. Researchers examined 629 inpatient admissions at two hospitals and identified four categories of system errors: constructing orders; editing orders; failing to complete new tasks; and selecting items from drop-down menus. Overall, both systems prevented more errors than they created, but the study recorded 1,164 prescribing errors. In both systems, the errors were most likely to occur when selecting a drop-down menu or editing information within the system. The authors concluded, "e-PS designs with fewer drop-down menu selections may reduce error risk."  (<a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/05/29/amiajnl-2013-001745.full"><span style="color: #0000ff;" color="#0000ff">The Safety of Electronic Prescribing: Manifestations, Mechanisms, and Rates of System-related Errors Associated with Two Commercial Systems in Hospitals</span></a>, <a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/05/29/amiajnl-2013-001745.full"><i><em><span style="color: #0000ff;" color="#0000ff">JAMIA</span></em></i></a>, May 30, 2013)</p>
<p>As the complexity of electronic health record (EHR) systems grows, <strong>it is becoming increasingly important to implement and configure these systems with an eye toward improving usability.</strong> An interface that is difficult, confusing, or downright annoying to use can be the death knell of a system – even if everything on the feature checklist is checked. Some organizations feel resigned to accept their EHR system as-is once it goes live.  Failing to develop an ongoing process to make user interfaces suit evolving patterns of use is a mistake. Recognizing that workflows and requirements change and software adjustments will be required as users become more proficient and sophisticated is critical.  Adopting simple strategies, like applying continuous quality improvement techniques to post implementation optimization efforts can make all the difference in promotion and enhancing adoption.

<p><strong>Copying and pasting text and data in electronic health records needs to stop</strong>, according to one article in <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/why-copying-pasting-ehr-notes-must-stop-46770-1.html?ET=healthdatamanagement:e3929:117919a:&st=email&utm_source=editorial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=HDM_DAILY_102113_101813">Health Data Management</a>. With the digitization of health records and increased pressure to ensure that those records are complete, some clinicians are inadvertently adopting poor electronic health record (EHR) documentation practices. Copying and pasting the same standardized text into fields within an EHR can make it difficult to show that real documentation is taking place, and can increase the risk of audit failures.  Moreover, there are significant quality and safety concerns; erroneous information may get reused causing errors to spread further than they otherwise would have.

<p><strong>When is an electronic health record (EHR)-generated e-communication too much?</strong> A recently published article points to some of the important work that lies ahead in "meaningful" use of EHRs. Surveyed primary care physicians in the VA – all using a relatively advanced implementation of an EHR that can generate patient-specific notifications of results and other issues in message format (not pop-up style decision support) – reported receiving on average 63 a day; 87 percent felt that was far too many and 70 percent that they could not effectively handle the volume. According to the lead author, some physicians are better at managing a volume others consider overload.
