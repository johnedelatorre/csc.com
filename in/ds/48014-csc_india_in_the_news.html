<p class="nogap"><a target="_blank" href="http://forbesindia.com/blog/technology/mnc/"><strong>India and Technology Multinationals – Part 1</strong></a></p>
<p>Forbes India, Jan 17, 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="nogap">The last year has seen a fair amount of churn in the leadership of technology multinationals in India. Intel appointed Debjani Ghosh and Kumud Srinivasan respectively as its managing director and president. Sap elevated Suprakash Chaudhuri to acting managing director after the resignation of Peter Gartenberg, his predecessor. In the last 30 days alone IBM appointed Vanitha Narayanan as its new managing director while CSC did the same with Neeraj Nityanand…When it comes to the presence of Indians on the companies executive leadership teams, Google and Intel are at the top with five and four respectively, even as Accenture, IBM, HP, CSC and Lenovo have zero representation. Of course revenue isn’t the only variable to analyze India’s importance for technology MNCs. So let’s look at the same data using India’s workforce contribution as the filter. Thus Accenture, IBM and CSC immediately start standing out for the lack of Indian executives in their senior leadership, despite the fact that 25-30 percent of their workforces are based in India. Conversely Google and Intel seem to be giving disproportionate importance to Indians in their senior leadership ranks regardless of the relative sizes of their Indian workforces.</p>

The increasing influence of social networks has not only provided an informal medium for in-person communication, but also provided a platform where open discussions could help solve various R&amp;D issues. Without compromising original idea content, developers have a more pervasive environment for discussion of development tools, usages, methodologies, algorithms etc."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="nogap">India needs to be transparent in awarding contracts as per published standards, says Neeraj Nityanand of CSC India. In late 1990s, when I accepted the role of managing director for Unocal India, it was a mandatory requirement for all individuals serving in global senior leadership roles to be instructed and certified by a reputed US law firm on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Every year one had to take a refresher course and recertify that was one fully trained and aware of the statutes, and also affirm that one did not violate the law. It was with part amusement and part serious consideration that one learnt the subtleties of what a ‘bribe’ is and what is ‘lube’.

We are creating a new “sense of things” from all the information we are collecting, processing and reordering. This Data-driven business demands a shift from collecting to connecting. Because data on its own is meaningless, data must be imbued with context to give it meaning, to make it unambiguous, to make it exciting.

However, with Indian enterprises starting to deploy enterprise mobility solutions, it may well be time to buckle down and start taking mobile security seriously.

<p>The Economics Times, June 24, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="nogap">Are you planning a job change? Have you accepted the offer or still in the negotiation phase? It is essential to understand that making the salary pitch too early or asking for too many changes in the counteroffer are some of the biggest goof-ups that a candidate can do. In conversation with tjinsite, research and knowledge arm of timesjobs.com, Neelam Gill Malhotra, VP-HR, CSC INDIA said that it is highly discouraged by HR professionals to make the interview process a platform for only negotiations or even starting the interview discussion with this topic. Advising candidates, Gaurav Seth, country head, hays India says, "Do your homework - go through salary surveys, and research through your industry association, network of contacts of people in the same industry/profession or recruitment consultants."</p>

<p>The Times of India- Times Ascent, June 13, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="nogap">The concept of ‘bring your own device’ (B.Y.O.D) is gaining momentum at the workplace. Bring Your Own Device to work describes the trend of employees bringing in personal devices like laptops, tablets, smart phones, etc to work and using them to carry out official work using organizational resources like databases, file servers, etc. “B.Y.O.D is an employee-enablement model and a key feature of the consumerisation movement in IT. Employees today are increasingly demanding access to real-time information anytime, anywhere and on any device of their choice. The B.Y.O.D policy infuses control, ownership and independence in the hands of the employee,” adds Neelam Gill Malhotra, VP HR, CSC India… “Enterprises need to look at measures to protect confidential data if a device is lost or stolen; this can be done by limiting user access to specific applications and data areas to minimise overall business risk. For example, at CSC, we have stringent processes to ensure data security in case of loss of devices. Data from the lost device can be wiped out remotely by a central command centre at CSC as soon as the employee reports the loss of a device,” explains Malhotra.</p>

<p>Express Computer, June 11, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="nogap">Considering the recent spate of growth in business data, India is set to witness an explosion in the number of data centers. That said, the fact remains that data centers are energy guzzlers. The growth in data center space also means that power consumption will skyrocket. Unfortunately, power is a scarce resource in India. Hence, the need for energy-efficient or green data centers becomes all the more critical… To track the performance of data centers and reduce their carbon footprint, companies use various energy-efficiency metrics and benchmarks. Prominent among these are Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCIE). Green Grid, a global consortium dedicated to developing and promoting energy-efficiency data centers, has developed these metrics. The PUE ratio indicates how much power a piece of computing equipment uses as compared to cooling and other overheads. “This is a credible and important standard to measure the overall energy-efficiency of a data center. DCIE is the reciprocal of PUE and is expressed as a percentage that improves as it approaches 100%,” said Kothandraman Karunagaran, Vice President - Global Infrastructure and Enterprise Services, CSC India.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="nogap">Employees are the backbone of any organization. An organization’s accomplishments are the work of its people.  What employees say about the company, how they act in the workplace, and how happy they are in their roles all impact brand, image, levels of service and ultimately customer satisfaction. Hence it is imperative for organizations to encourage initiative, recognize individual contribution, treat each person with respect and fairness and provide ample opportunity for professional growth. With the high rate of turnover in the IT industry, proper assimilation of new employees into the organization, making them comfortable and showing them a clear career growth path is also extremely important to increase productivity and meet business objectives.</p>
